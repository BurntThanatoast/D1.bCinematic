This projects satifies all 8 key requirements from the assignment guide.

-It satisfies having 3+ scenes as it has the scenes body (with the studio intro), body2 (with the animation of some part of the game), body3 (with the game menu screen).  This is of course ignoring the initial intro scene that you need to click in order to start going through the 'slideshow'

-It has two audio assets that are both .mp3 files.  Specifically we have boom.mp3 which is the Vine Boom from Bluezone Cinematic Impacts' sound library.  As well as the music.mp3 which is the song Pirate Lagoon from Diddy Kong racing made by Nintendo.  The boom.mp3 is used when the slide of the studio introduction is played.  The music.mp3 is played when you reach the main menu.

-There are 2 image assets which are both png files.  Specifically BallWorld.png, which is used as the background of the main menu screen, and Bozo Studio.png, which is used as the transparent image for the studio logo on the studio introduction slide.  Both of the image files were made by me in Photoshop.

-There are in fact 2+ geometric shapes in this slideshow.  On the animated slide with the teaser of some part of the game I create 4 circles to use.  This should satisfy having 2 or more geometric shapes even if they are the same shape.  That part wasn't exactly clear, but I assume it's fine since it didn't say I couldn't use both.

-There is 1 logotype text.  I made it a png and it is called TitleText.png.  It is some simple old 8bit font with a nice color that complements the menu background color.

-There is 1 multi-line text block which is on the menu screen.  It has the text listing Play then another line with Options and then another line with Credits, and then a final line with Quit.

-There is 1 fading scene transition.  This is for the studio slide to the teaser gameplay slide.  The studio slide begins to fade to black after 2 seconds if you don't click to skip to the next slide.  Then the teaser gameplay slide fades in for 1 second.

-There is at least 1 object motion animation.  On the teaser gameplay slide there is the 4 circles as mentioned before.  The circles all fall from the top of the screen with different falling speeds and they all loop after they reach the bottom.
